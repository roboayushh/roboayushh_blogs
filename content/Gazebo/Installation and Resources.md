first ask them to verify the versions of ros2 they are using, then show them the table and ask them to install according to their versions only, 
link to the official website
then show them where its installed, navigate them to the different folder and files structure and show them code bases, how its used and build the concepts to them

Please have patience to read the entire module, and explore everything all by yourself. There are a bunch of resources, examples and materials mentioned in this module which will be extremely helpful to learn and make seamless robotic simulations in gazebo !

An important aspect of using these commands is to know what is getting installed in your local system to have a deep understanding of the entire core system of gazebo. 
Here's where the primary files and folders are placed:

#### **Executables (`/usr/bin/`)**

This directory contains the main command-line programs you use to run and interact with Gazebo.

- **gz:** The primary command-line interface. You use it as a gateway to other tools (e.g., `gz sim`, `gz topic`).
    
- **gz sim:** The main executable to run a simulation. It starts the simulation server.
    
- **gz gui:** The executable for the graphical user interface (GUI). It can run standalone or connect to a simulation server.
    
- **gz topic:** A tool for inspecting the messages being passed between different parts of the simulation.
    
- **gz service:** A tool to call services provided by the simulation.
    
- **gz fuel:** A command-line tool for interacting with the Gazebo Fuel server, which hosts a global collection of robot models and worlds.
    

#### **Shared Libraries (`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`)**

This is where the core logic of Gazebo lives. These are the compiled libraries that the executables use to function.

- **libgz-sim-8.so, libgz-transport-13.so, etc.:** These `.so` (shared object) files are the heart of Gazebo. They contain the code for the physics engine, sensor generation, rendering, message passing, and more. The number (e.g., `-8`, `-13`) corresponds to the library's major version. Your custom plugins and applications will link against these libraries.
    

#### **Plugins (`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gz-sim-8/plugins/`)**

Gazebo is highly modular, and much of its functionality comes from plugins.

- **libgz-sim-physics-plugin.so, libgz-sim-sensors-plugin.so, etc.:** These are specialized libraries that are loaded at runtime to provide specific features. For example, one plugin might provide the physics engine, while others provide functionality for cameras, LIDAR, or differential drive controllers.
    

#### **Resource & Asset Files (`/usr/share/gz/`)**

This directory contains platform-independent data files needed by the simulator.

- **/usr/share/gz/gz-sim-8/worlds/:** Contains **`.sdf`** files that define pre-built simulation environments, like empty worlds or rooms with obstacles.
    
- **/usr/share/gz/gz-sim-8/gui/:** Contains configuration files (**`.config`**) and QML files that define the appearance and layout of the graphical interface.
    
- **/usr/share/gz/gz-fuel-tools-8/models/:** This acts as a local cache for models you download from the Gazebo Fuel server. When you use a model like a "delivery drone" from the online database, it gets stored here.
    

#### **Development Files (`/usr/include/` and `/usr/lib/cmake/`)**

These files are essential if you plan to write your own C++ applications or plugins for Gazebo.

- **/usr/include/gz/:** Contains the C++ **header files** (**.h**, **.hpp**). Your code needs to `#include` these files to use Gazebo's classes and functions.
    
- **/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/:** Contains **CMake configuration files** (`.cmake`). These files help the CMake build system automatically find the correct libraries and include files when you are compiling your own Gazebo-related software.

### How to List All Installed Files Yourself

If you need to see the exact list of every file installed by a specific package, you can use the `dpkg` command. For example, to see every file installed by the core simulator package, you would run:

Bash

```
dpkg -L gz-sim8
```

You would need to run this for each of the `gz-harmonic` dependencies (like `gz-gui8`, `gz-transport13`, etc.) to get a complete picture.





As of ROS 2 Jazzy, Gazebo is available from the ROS package repository via vendor packages. [[1]](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/ros2_gz_vendor_pkgs/#id2).
